# Golf Tournament Performance Predictor

This project aims to predict the performance of golf players in an upcoming tournament by analyzing historical data, including strokes gained, course information, and weather data. The model uses a Ridge regression with polynomial features to capture more complex relationships between variables and prevent overfitting.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and set up a virtual environment with the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- pip
- virtualenv

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golf-tournament-predictor.git
   cd golf-tournament-predictor
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Replace the placeholders in the script with your OpenWeatherMap API key, CSV file paths, and other relevant information.

5. Run the script to predict the golf players' performance in the upcoming tournament:

   ```
   python predictor.py
   ```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

The CI/CD pipeline for this project includes building, testing, and deploying the application across different environments (development, production).

### Pipeline Overview

1. Build: Check out the source code and create a clean environment.
2. Test: Run unit tests and validate the code quality.
3. Deploy (Development): Deploy the application to the development environment.
4. Deploy (Production): Deploy the application to the production environment after manual approval.

### CI/CD Steps

#### 1. Build

- Set up a build environment using a Python Docker image.
- Check out the source code from the repository.
- Install the required dependencies using `pip`.

#### 2. Test

- Run unit tests using a test runner like `pytest` or `unittest`.
- Analyze code quality using tools like `flake8`, `pylint`, or `black`.
- Check code coverage using `coverage.py` or a similar tool.
- Publish test results and code coverage reports.

#### 3. Deploy (Development)

- Deploy the application to the development environment.
- Run integration tests to validate the deployment.
- Verify that the application is running correctly and meeting the requirements.

#### 4. Deploy (Production)

- Wait for manual approval before deploying to the production environment.
- Deploy the application to the production environment.
- Run smoke tests to validate the deployment.
- Monitor the application's performance and resource usage in production.
